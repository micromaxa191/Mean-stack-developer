Google offering ₹ 2 crores, Facebook offering ₹ 1.5 crore, Uber offering ₹ 1 crore, etc. Sky is the limit for you.

Its really good to see that you are motivated to get the highest paid job in the IT industry. The overall IT industry is comprised of various types roles which may offer you a a better career growth. In order to get desired pay package and additional benefits, employees need to train themselves on the correct fields and choose job opportunities that are worth their interest.

The salary range is mainly based on the company. There are mainly two kinds of company that pays huge ,

Very well established companies that spends a bomb to get the best talent in the market.
Those startup’s with huge VC investment will spend better than big shots to attract those engineers in the established companies.
That being said i know a few software engineers that earn 48 Lakhs + annually( Fixed component)


The expected salary for freshers is from Rs. 2.4 Lakh PA to Rs. 8.5 Lakh PA for jobs in India by the major MNCs. However, the top notch financial sector giants like Moody’s, Meryl & Lynch, HSBC, Goldman Sachs etc along with Big tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Directi, etc offer Rs. 10-30 Lakh PA to the graduates of IITs, NITs, VIT, BITS and Manipal. The middle range MNCs like Mu-Sigma and Samsung easily offer Rs. 6.5 Lakh to Rs. 8.5 Lakh PA to the graduates of government and better private engineering colleges.
